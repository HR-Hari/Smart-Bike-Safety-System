# Smart Bike Safety System

A **Smart Bike Safety System** for motor bikes using a **dual-microcontroller architecture**.  
The system detects theft attempts, abnormal movement, crash events, and **rider alcohol consumption**, sends **real-time alerts with GPS location** to the owner via **GSM**, and can **remotely disable the engine** for enhanced safety and security.

## Project Overview

Motor bike theft, unsafe riding, and delayed accident response remain major challenges.  
This project presents a **smart embedded safety and anti-theft solution** using **ESP32-based controllers**, inertial sensing, alcohol detection, GPS tracking, and GSM communication.

The system is divided into:

- **Master Unit (ESP32)** – Handles GPS tracking, GSM communication, crash detection, theft response, and engine cutoff.  
- **Slave Unit (ESP32-C3 Mini)** – Dedicated to rider safety monitoring, including alcohol detection and environmental sensing.

This modular design improves **reliability, power efficiency, fault isolation, and scalability**.

## System Functionality & Working

The Smart Bike Safety System operates using a **distributed dual-controller architecture** to ensure reliable monitoring and fast response. The **ESP32 Master unit**, powered directly from the bike battery, acts as the central control node responsible for decision-making, communication, and engine control. It interfaces with a **SIM900A GSM module** for SMS alerts, a **NEO-M8N GPS module** for real-time location tracking, a **5V relay** for engine cutoff, and an **MPU6050 inertial sensor** for detecting crash events and abnormal vehicle motion.

A secondary **ESP32-C3 Mini Slave unit**, powered by a rechargeable 5V battery, focuses on **rider safety monitoring**. It continuously measures alcohol concentration using the **MQ-3 alcohol sensor** and environmental conditions using the **DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor**. The Slave unit communicates safety status data wirelessly to the Master using **ESP-NOW**, enabling low-latency and power-efficient data transfer without relying on external networks.

During operation, the system continuously evaluates inputs from both controllers. If **alcohol consumption exceeds a predefined threshold**, a **crash is detected**, or **unauthorized movement** is identified, the Master unit immediately retrieves GPS coordinates and sends an **SMS alert via GSM** to the registered user. In critical scenarios, the system activates the **engine cutoff relay**, preventing the bike from being started or continuing operation. This integrated approach ensures **theft prevention, rider safety, and rapid incident notification** in a single embedded solution.

## Objectives

- Detect unauthorized movement or theft attempts  
- Detect crash events using inertial sensing  
- Detect rider alcohol consumption before or during riding  
- Send real-time SMS alerts with GPS location  
- Remotely disable the bike engine when unsafe conditions are detected  
- Implement a low-cost, embedded IoT-based safety system
